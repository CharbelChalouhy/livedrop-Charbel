## ShopLite Product Catalog System

**Doc ID**: `DOC-001`

ShopLite’s product catalog is a centralized service that stores and serves structured metadata for all SKUs sold on the platform. It contains fields like product ID, name, description, pricing, availability, seller details, and category taxonomy. Each SKU is uniquely identified and can support multiple variants (e.g., size, color). The catalog integrates directly with the inventory system, allowing real-time updates when stock levels change. Products are indexed for search and are also exposed through APIs to ShopLite’s mobile and web clients. This system is designed for high read throughput and supports pagination, sorting, and filtering. Category mapping follows a three-level hierarchy (e.g., Apparel > Women > Tops), which improves discoverability. ShopLite also uses this data in downstream recommendation systems. Updates are versioned for consistency and audit trails. Popular SKUs are cached in Redis to reduce latency. All catalog data must comply with formatting, safety, and content guidelines.

## FAQ Assistant Overview

**Doc ID**: `DOC-002`

The FAQ Assistant is an AI-powered support tool designed to reduce contact rates and improve self-service resolution. Trained on the most common customer questions, it can provide real-time answers based on structured FAQ content maintained by ShopLite's CX team. It integrates into both mobile and web interfaces via a chat widget. The assistant uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to surface accurate answers. It supports fallback handoffs to human agents in cases of confusion or escalation. All interactions are logged, and the assistant is continuously evaluated for accuracy. PII is never stored, and all queries are anonymized before being processed. The assistant runs on a low-latency LLM API backend with a cache-first architecture. When confidence is low, the assistant will rephrase the question to clarify intent. Updates to FAQ content go through a publishing workflow with version control. Usage metrics include resolution rate, abandonment, and latency. ShopLite has observed a 22% reduction in ticket volume since its launch.
