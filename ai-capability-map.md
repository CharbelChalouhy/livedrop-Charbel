###  Selection Rationale

We chose the **FAQ Assistant** and **Smart Search Suggestions** because:

- They use content **already available** in this sprint (`FAQ.md`, product data).
- Both are **low-risk** to launch and measure impact.
- They target clear KPIs:
  -  FAQ Assistant → reduces support contact rate
  -  Smart Suggestions → improves product discoverability and search-to-cart conversion
